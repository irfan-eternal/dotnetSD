# dotnetSD

This is a Fork of https://github.com/holly-hacker/EazFixer

##Why I Created it 

I Had Multiple Situations were EazFixer was not able to Correctly Identify the Encryption Function. So I added 2 Commandline Option which will tell the tool which is the Encryprion Function

Usage

Call from the command line
```
dotnetSD.exe --file <file_name> --type <type_of_encryption_function> --method <name_of_encryption_function>
```
All other Options Work Same as EazFixer
